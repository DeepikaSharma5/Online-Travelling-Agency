<h4>Gall Dutch Fort</h4>
<p>Built several years ago on a massive piece of land in Galle, the Galle Dutch Fort was used by the Portuguese until the Dutch took over it. The 
British finally sealed the fort as theirs with a lot of re-building and renovation. The unique blends that led to the standing of this monumental structure
 are now listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Sites thus deserving a substantial place on the list of places to visit in Galle. 
The area is so beautiful, that is a favourite amongst couples for a pre-wedding shoot.It's open for 24 hours and free entrance.</p>

<h4>The Jungle Beach</h4>
<p>The Jungle Beach is an out-of-the-way and serene beach that is a storehouse of all the quiet time you need on your holiday. Located a little ahead of the
 Japanese Peace Pagoda, this Beach is one of the most relaxed one and is much less swarming than all the other tourist places in Galle. 
You can sit back on the sandy beach and get a perfect tan, or swim in the clear waters that seem like a mirror image of the ground below. If you are a fan of 
the aquatic life, then you could spend some time Snorkeling to see for yourself the life of the rich marine life in Galle.</p>

<h4>The JapanesePeace Pagoda</h4>
<p>The Japanese Peace Pagoda is for all those people who are looking for inner peace and some time for introspection. This tranquil structure built not so long ago is 
perched on top of the Rumassala Hill from where you can see the expansive ocean and the thick jungles. Take a deeper dip into this composure and attend the daily ritual
 that they perform every evening at 05.30 p.m. 
The construction is tall enough to be visible for people standing on the Unawatuna Beach and Galle Beach. The aura at dusk is fascinating and rides one into another world of beauty. </p>

<h4>Turtle Watch</h4>
<p>Some people of Sri Lanka have dedicated their lives to animals around the Seas, and the Sea Turtle Hatchery is run by one such family. Every member is steadfast
 towards helping out the sea turtles who need medical help, or those who are pregnant.
In fact, they even help the sea turtles breed, and provide them with a safe environment to lay their eggs and care for them. The reason why it is one of the best 
places to visit in Galle is that, you will get to witness all of that at once during a short detour to this turtle abode. </p>

<h4>Galle Lighthouse</h4>
<p>If you are done admiring the beauty of the tall Lighthouse in Galle, then you should walk down to the beach that it superintends, also called Lighthouse Beach.
 This beach is best for sitting by the shimmering sand and staring at the sea till your eyes meet the horizon. You must take good care when here as there are many slippery 
 rocks which could lead to a fall.This is a great way to spend a day walking around the lighthouse, eating and shopping around Galle Fort. The lighthouse and the ocean is beautiful. </p>
