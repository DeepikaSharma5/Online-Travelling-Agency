<h4>Pigeon Island Snorkelling</h4>
<p>Pigeon Island is one of those picture-perfect places that everyone talks about. As soon as you get to Trincomalee people will ask
 are you going to Pigeon Island (if you haven't already heard about it before you get to Trincomalee)
It's basically a famous snorkel spot on the East coast. You have to get a boat to the island which is around 20 minutes and you 
pay an entrance to enter the Pigeon Island, National Park. 
All of the beaches arrange day trips to Pigeon Island so if you fancy going with an organised tour then simply pick one. They are 
all priced fairly and it organises your transport and everything for you which takes away any fuss. 
You'll get to experience the sea life that inhabits the shallow waters just off Nilaveli. Feast your eyes on colourful corals and s
parkling fish. If you've never snorkelled before or you simply love snorkelling then this is one of the great places to visit in Trincomalee.</p>

<h4>Nilaveli Beach </h4>
<p>Regarded as one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka this is a stretch of beach which is situated approximately 
16 kilometres North of Trincomalee. It's the starting point for Pigeon island but its also the perfect spot for watersports, relaxing and just 
enjoying the sun. There are a lot of big hotel resorts located in this area. Beautiful beach with lifeguards and an exclusive view of pigeon island.
The beach is long and there are many places to get onto it. There is one access point north of the Navy station. It’s lovely, very European but has no shade. The public beach just south of the Navy place is where the boats go to Pigeon island from
Shops,restaurants,bike rentals,boat tours and accommodations for every kind of budget.Safe haven as there are police men patrolling around the clock.
You can reach here via moped which are rented for cheap all over Trincomalee.</p>

<h4>Fort Frederic</h4>
<p>Built in the 1600s, Ford Frederick is a colonial fort that was built by the Portuguese. It’s now used by the Sri Lankan Military
 but the public can go see it. You might find lots of deer hidden there amongst other wildlife, and if you want to escape the shade, then this is the spot to head to.Can enjoy the day with your 
 family or your loved one.Can enjoy the small moment in that dark before seeing the light</p>

<h4>Whale Watching</h4>
<p>Trincomalee is famous for its whale watching and it’s got the opposite season for whale watching in the South Coast of Mirissa which means 
if you missed it there, you can find it here.Again there are whale watching tours advertised all over the beach and for varying prices. When we visited the season for whale
 watching was over, so I wouldn’t bother paying as there is a good chance you will be disappointed. </p>

<h4>Koneswaram Temple</h4>
<p>This is truly one of the best places to visit in Trincomalee because it’s so beautiful. It’s an ancient
 temple to the Hindu god Shiva surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery. If you only visit a few temples when backpacking Sri Lanka, then make this one of them.It’s also known as
 the temple of 1000 pillars and it exudes exquisite detail which just adds
 to the beauty. Hindu people even from India come here to pray the big shiva statue. If you arrive early you can catch a beautiful sunrise experience which is loved by many people.</p>

<center><img src ="photo/hot.jpg" alt =" Kanniya Hot Springs" width="200" height="150"></center><br/><br/>
<h4>Kanniya Hot Springs</h4>
<p>The perfect places to visit in Trincomalee is the Kanniyahot springs.
 They are little “holes” in the ground that are quite small. There are seven wells and they are about 4 ft deep and in a square shape. 
The temperature of each spring varies, and sometimes you’ll find locals washing in the water, even though they aren’t meant too. 
But if you want to experience something different, then definitely make a trip to the Kanniya hot Springs. It’s suggested to go super early like 6 am if you want to beat the crowds. </p>
