<h4>The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi</h4>
<p>The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is<b> one of the most ancient trees which are living even today</b> standing tall in the Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. 
The tree is believed to have sprouted from a cutting brought from Bodh Gaya in India, where Gautama Buddha had attained enlightenment.<b>The tree is an authentic and 
living link to Gautama Buddha and is often respected as the oldest tree in history which has a recorded date of the plantation.</b>
This ancient Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree has been protected and cared for by many years by the ancient kings and queens as well as the Buddhist monks.<b> Today the 
tree is surrounded by statues, water canals and golden fences which make the site even more holy and spiritual enhancing its natural beauty.</b> Although the tree
 is sacred for the Buddhist and they pray it all the time...</p>

<h4>Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba</h4>
<p>Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba is built nearly 2500 years ago,accomplishing a prediction made by Lord Buddha himself, Ruwanweli Seya or the pagoda of golden dust, was one of the
 largest structures in the ancient world, standing 103 m tall with a circumference of 290 m.
<b>Also known as the Mahathupa, Swarnamali Chaitya, Suvarnamali Mahaceti and Rathnamali Dagaba,</b> the stupa is an engineering feast and a testimony to the engineering capabilities
 of the ancient Sri Lankans.Yet with the advancement of the sciences and understanding of the Mahathupa's true structure many experts and commoners alike are questioning the
 true purpose of the Mahathupa. Is it only a mega structure protecting and encasing the relics of Lord Buddha or did it have a larger function still unknown to the 'advanced'
 civilisations of today.</p>

<h4>Jetavanaramaya monastery</h4>
<p>Jetavanaramaya monastery is<b> one of the largest monasteries in the heritage city of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka.</b> This magnificent structure was the <b>third-largest structure 
 in the ancient world. </b>Legend has it that a part of Buddha's sash or belt was tied and preserved here at the Jetavanaramaya monastery.
The Jetavanaramaya stupa comes with a fascinating historical significance which depicts the differences going on between the two sects of Buddhism- Theravada and Mahayana sects 
of Buddhism. Today, the stupa is no longer the tallest, but is one of the largest in the world, with an area of over five hectares and housing over 10,000 monks.
The Jetavanaram stupa is a great way to experience the Buddhist culture in its purest form.</p>

<h4>Archaeological museum</h4>
<p>Established in the year 1947 by the efforts of Dr Senarath Paranavithana, the archaeological museum or Puravidu Bhavana of Anuradhapura holds some
 exciting artefacts, carvings and ancient everyday items found after excavations in Anuradhapura and other historical sites around Sri Lanka. It is a rich
 source of information on the heritage and culture of the place. The museum displays artefacts connected with ancient capital located at Polonnaruwa which are
 worth watching, especially the miniature models of buildings. Many objects kept in the Anuradhapura Archaeological 
 Museum date back to the pre-Christian period and reflect the grandeur of a bygone era when Sinhalese civilization was at its peak. </p>

<h4>Ritigala forest monastery</h4>
<p>Ritigala situated between Polonnaruwa and the old town of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka is a hilly forest and a place of Buddhist worship.
 The monastery is named after the 40m tall Ritigala trees in the mid slopes of the hill; this Buddhist monastery has inscriptions that date back to 1st century BC.

The highest of the peaks in the Ritigala mountain range is the Ritigala Kanda that makes for an excellent trekking adventure. A journey through the stonework 
bordering the streams, dense forests consisting of medicinal herbs and trees, gardens and courtyards with beautiful landscaping leads its way to the temple.
 Legend has it that herb called 'Sansevi' found near the crest, on consumption gives eternal life. It is also an ancient legend that these mountains once hosted 
 Hanuman and Sita on their expedition from Sri Lanka to India.  Like this, there is so much of history and archaeological study associated with Ritigala.

 <h4>Isurumuniya temple</h4>
 <p>Sri Lanka's ancient capital city, Anuradhapura is home to relics, stupas and rocky hills that bring an aura of serenity. Isurumuniya is one of the
 granite, marble and stone structures located near Tissa Wewa, and this Buddhist temple boasts of architecture and sculptures that showcase the emancipation of the artists.

The structure of Isurumuniya is a crossover between a temple and a fortress. It was erected as a dorm for 500 kids and then evolved to becoming a temple 
owing to its sanctity. Ever since then, Isurumuniya nurtures young minds and leads them along the path of spirituality, wisdom and council. It shelters
 tourists and serves as an abode that facilitates religious teachings and discipline. The structure evokes decorum and the carvings on stone are beyond
 thought provoking. This divine structure comes to life with internationally acclaimed inscriptions of the Isurumuniya Lovers, Elephant Pond and The Royal Family.</p>
