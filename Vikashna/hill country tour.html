city with a mixture of modern life and remnants of a bygone colonial  era. Due 
to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea  trade 
routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. However it  was 
only made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British 
 Empire in 1815. The main city is home to a majority of the Sri Lanka’s 
corporate  offices, restaurants and entertainment venues. On this tour you will 
visit many  of the historical, religious and commercial sites of Colombo
