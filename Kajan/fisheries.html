<h1>Deep seas and pristine rivers</h1><br>
<h3>Enjoy Sri Lanka’s best fishing excursions with our experts</h3>
<p>Surrounded by the warm and nutrient-filled waters and filled with many rivers and lakes, Sri Lanka enjoys a wealth of angling opportunities. 
Inland fishing - in fresh as well as in brackish waters - and deep sea fishing are both available at different times of the year, depending on the season. 
Owing to the different climatic conditions in different parts of the small island, excellent fishing opportunities can be found throughout the year.
 And Toprapane Team’s professional guides are here to guide you on your next angling adventure!
<br/><br/>
Sri Lanka’s position in the Indian Ocean means that great deep sea fishing experiences can be had in almost every direction off the country’s coast. 
From November to April, the best deep sea sport fishing areas are the Western and Southern coasts, in April the South-Eastern coast, and from May to September,
 the Eastern coast opens up.
<br/><br/>
Estuaries as well as rivers and lakes with brackish water, meaning that they have a high mineral content, offer a different fishing experience. 
Toprapane Team takes you to Madu Ganga, considered the best in Sri Lanka. Fish such as Barramundi, Mangrove Jack, Bull-Eyed Mackerel can be found in these waters.
 In higher-salinity situations, smaller Travilly and Barracudas have been known to get caught.
<br/><br/>
All these fishing experiences are available for experts and beginners. Toprapane Team will provide you with high-quality equipment – life-jackets, fishing rods,
 tackle etc. – and ensure you the best possible fishing experience possible.
<br/><br/>
Guests are recommended to bring sunscreen, sunglasses, insect repellents, and clothing to fit the activity. Since river, lake, and especially deep sea fishing experiences 
include taking a boat out into bodies of water, guests are advised to wear all protective gear at all times, and follow the safety instructions. While Toprapane Team does 
everything to ensure guest safety, we request that guest take responsibility for their own safety as well as the safety of others.<p>
